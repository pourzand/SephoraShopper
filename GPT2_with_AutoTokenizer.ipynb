All the way from LaMer to FIT me. This is so perfect for me. You can layer this up nicely. I can get a solid medium from two layers of this. I use a moisturizing illuminating primer such as the Becca one, touch up with my Too Faced Born this way concealer, the newest one, and I’m good. Lasts, and looks good all day. | Rating: 5\n"

      "5904     Review: I really love this foundation. It has a very natural finish and looks like you are not wearing any make-up, yet it covers any imperfections. It also gives a luminous glow. I highly recommend it. Try a sample at Sephora first if you are not sure. I took a small sample and tried it for a few days and received a lot of compliments. | Rating: 5\n",

    "1.  I have mixed feelings about how the formula works out and it feels heavier on the skin. That being said, I have to say it lasts so long and feels good on the skin. And is very buildable. I feel like it could work for me when I am on a hot weather day (e.g. hot summer) and sometimes it looks cakey on my face. I have very oily/combination/dry skin, probably at least with a bit more moisturizer. I wore this to the gym and nothing else. I would say it lasts a LONG time without oxidizing and without looking patchy at all so I would say it is pretty good for a combination skin day in the winter. Pros: a very fair skin tone/foundation and skin prep | Rating: 5\n",
