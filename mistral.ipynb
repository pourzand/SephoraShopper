      "Review: Fifty year old gal here, my skin is normal to dry, more dry in the winter, but let’s just say, I need moisture. I love this foundation so much, and honey, I’ve tried them all. All the way from LaMer to FIT me. This is so perfect for me. You can layer this up nicely. I can get a solid medium from two layers of this. I use a moisturizing illuminating primer such as the Becca one, touch up with my Too Faced Born this way concealer, the newest one, and I’m good. Lasts, and looks good all day. | Rating: 5\n"

I feel like it could work for me when I am on a hot weather day (e.g. hot summer) and sometimes it looks cakey on my face. I have very oily/combination/dry skin, probably at least with a bit more moisturizer. I wore this to the gym and nothing else. I would say it lasts a LONG time without oxidizing and without looking patchy at all so I would say it is pretty good for a combination skin day in the winter.
